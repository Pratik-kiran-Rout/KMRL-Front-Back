# KMRL DocHub Backend Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

KMRL DocHub is an intelligent document management and compliance platform designed for Kochi Metro Rail Limited. The backend will serve as the core intelligence engine supporting AI-powered document processing, real-time analytics, multi-language support, IoT integration, and comprehensive compliance management. This roadmap has been updated to better align with the detailed solution architecture, incorporating enhancements such as Milvus as the primary vector DB, integration with BHASHINI API for bilingual vector handling, OpenCV for image preprocessing, and optional Google Vision for OCR edge cases. The prototype strategy for hackathon demos has been added as a separate section using cost-free alternatives.

## Architecture Vision

The backend is designed as a microservices architecture with AI-first approach, supporting multiple AI models for different use cases:

- **Document Intelligence**: OCR, NLP, summarization
- **Conversational AI**: Chatbot and voice interfaces  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Trend analysis and forecasting
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relationship mapping and discovery
- **Computer Vision**: AR preview and document analysis

The architecture emphasizes modularity, fault isolation through layered services (Ingestion, Processing, Intelligence, User Interface, Operations), hybrid on-prem/cloud deployment, AI feedback loops for model improvement, and green computing practices (e.g., auto-shutdown of idle resources).
